title: Betting on advanced nuclear power
---
At the time of this writing, I am 57 years old. I bet we will not see a commercial thorium or fusion reactor in my lifetime. 

Furthermore, I bet we will not see such a reactor in your lifetime, either, no matter how old you are. 

## Fusion
First, let's talk fusion. I started paying attention to nuclear power as a teenager, around the beginning of the Reagan era. Feelings were mixed then. On one hand, some people still believed the promises of "too cheap to meter". On the other, fear of nuclear reactors was inseparable from the fear of nuclear war in others. And at different times, I was on both sides. 

From there, I got interested in fusion. We were already being told it was "just around the corner", just a brief inevitable tech breakthrough away, and we'd *finally* have "too cheap to meter", without dangerous radioactive waste or bomb precursors. That was over 40 years ago. Yet so many *still* believe it's "just around the corner". It's not. Even if someone can work out sustained reaction, there's the problem of fuel. Deuterium is hard to ignite. Tritium is exceedingly rare and expensive. We may have to literally "boil the ocean", looking for those tritium needles in our hydrogen haystack. That's if someone can make a sustained reaction in the first place, which may well never happen. 


## Thorium
The debunking site [Thorium Myths](https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium-myths.html) does an excellent job explaining why not only has there never been a commercial thorium reactor, but no one is even working on one. Basically, it boils down to two things:
1. The benefits attributed to "thorium" are actually benefits of fast breeder molten salt reactors, and that works with uranium too
2. There are gotchas in the thorium cycle, like polonium poisoning, that are *extremely* difficult in practice to solve

Conspiracy theories abound as to why there's never been any progress on thorium for, oh, 60 years now. But the simpler explanation is just that, despite what all the Very Intelligent Men on the Internet think, it's actually very difficult to do.
