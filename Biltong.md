Biltong is like beef jerky, only better. I eat a lot of it... an ounce a day is part of my regular diet. 

Once I started really getting into biltong, I tried a number of brands to see which one I liked best. Biltong seasoning is very tradition, so most taste pretty similar to one another. Biltong is marinated in vinegar seasoned with salt, coriander, rosemary, and black pepper, with no sugar added. Different "flavors" are usually additions to this common profile - some hickory smoke, or garlic, or "peri-peri" chili pepper. 

Texture is even more consistent. It's all beef steaks, air-dried, then sliced as thin as is practical. The thin slicing makes it easier to chew than the chunkiness of American jerky. 

So how do various brands differ? Not much. They're similar enough that I'd have a hard time telling them apart, at least for the basic flavors (regular and peri-peri). 

That said, after doing some A/B comparison, one brand stands out - Ayoba. They add worchestershire sauce to the basic seasoning, giving it a more complex flavor, and their texture is softer. There seem to be less crumbs in the bag, too - crumbs being a common problem with biltong. 

An honorable mention goes to Righteous Felon. I've only tried their "Nelson Mandilla" flavor, a rather daring flavor that adds a lot of dill to the basic biltong profile. But for others? I have eaten a lot of Stryve, just because a nearly store carries it, and I don't think I could tell it from Made By True in a blind test. 

So in the end, any biltong makes me happy, but I prefer Ayoba if I can get it. Whole Foods carries it, so it's only a little out of my way to find.
