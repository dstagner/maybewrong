# Deploying my digital garden
### What do you want?
I want to use a [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) approach to create an online website for expressing my thoughts to others. 
### What is your problem?
I want to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to compose and organize those thoughts, but need an easy and automatic way to convert the Obsidian markdown files to a web site. 

## A digital garden toolkit
- *Obsidian*: Composition and organization
- *Jekyll*: Markdown to html conversion
- *Github*: Version control, possibly website hosting using [Github Pages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)
- *Netlify*: Advanced website hosting

I can only deploy one site to github pages - [http://dstagner.github.io/](http://dstagner.github.io/). I can map another domain to it with a CNAME, but that would probably be davestagner.com, if anything. I have a site there now, but it's woefully out of date. 

So I should probably host maybewrong.org on Netlify, and maybe continue hosting davestagner.com there as well. It doesn't cost anything but setup time. 

Another possibility is Obsidian's hosting service, but a: It's $20/mo, kind of steep for what it delivers; and b: it makes me dependent on Obsidian as a company, whereas the Obsidan > Jekyll > Github > Netlify workflow does not.
