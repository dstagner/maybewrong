A non-exhaustive list of records I've been on... (newest to oldest)

### as Dave Stagner
* *I Wanna Vaccination* (2021) - A comedy single, a parody of the Ramone's "I Wanna Be Sedated", written by my friend Brian Smith and performed with Justin Hartley, in true punk fashion.
* *I'm Sorry Moon* (2021) - A two-track EP featuring "I'm Sorry Moon", which I had written and recorded just before my first vocal surgery, and "Sublime", which won the 2018 OVFF songwriting contest. (The theme was "psychedelic".)
* *Hotel Concellation* (2020) - In 2020, when all the cons shut down, someone formed the "Concellation" group on Facebook, for an imaginary con that never happens. I thought it needed a theme song, so I wrote one. It's better than my other COVID-related songs, for sure. 
* *This Is How Elvis Died* (2019) - A little five-song EP of comedy material, to capitalize on the Logan Award nomination I had received for the song "This Is How Elvis Died", and to *finally* get a recording of "FIreworks Pornography & Cheese" out the door. 
* *Loose Ends* (2016) - A scattered collection of demos. Not all great performances, but some fine songs. 

### with Beth Kinderman
* *It Came from the FuMP* (2020) - A collection of various comedy singles Beth has released over recent years, some with me, some without. 
* *The Hero's Journey* (2019) - Our magnum opus. A seventeen song concept album about Joseph Campbell's "Hero with a thousand faces" theories of mythology, with one song for each step in the hero cycle. I cannot begin to count the hours of effort put into this album. 
* *Stop Covering Hallelujah* (2018) - A comedy single, released with censored and uncensored versions. The uncensored version has some really hilarious euphemisms for the act of love; the censored version replaces them with foley noises by Justin Hartley. 
* *Departure: A Hero's Journey EP* (2018) - A preview release of the first few tracks of *The Hero's Journey*. 
* *Underneath the Mask (2018 Anniversary Edition)* (2018) For our tenth anniversary of working together, we re-recorded this classic from our first album. It was used as preview music in my Fringe Festival show, *The Tragedy of Obi-Wan Kenobi*.
* *The Dread Gazebo* (2018) - Another comedy single about D&D, because we love them.
* *Refusal of the Call* (2014) - An early recording single of the "single" from *The Hero's Journey*.
* *Return of the Son of More Songs About Robots & Death* (2013) - The last of the "Songs About Robots & Death" series (so far). This one was all parodies. It features a hidden track where Justin and I did a parody of Beth's song "Zombies", which is on every other Songs About Robots & Death EP. 
* *Winter Is Coming* (2011) - Our first album with Elizabeth in the band. Elizabeth's first exposure to Beth's music was the very first time she ever met Beth. They weren't even introduced. Elizabeth was at a party at my house, and Beth came in all excited about a new song, and played "Stone Game" for me. I'm pretty sure Elizabeth fell in love with Beth's music in that moment. The whole "Fool's Trilogy" is some of my favorite work of ours, a really fantastic combination of songwriting, arrangement, and production. 
* *More Songs About Robots & Death* (2010) - The second of our comedy/cover EPs, when we got the Zappa-reference names going. I'm actually not really happy with this one. I was in a transitional place as a producer, and I think the mix is mostly terrible. There's some good material, though. This one was built around classic rock covers. We still play the Space Oddity/Major Tom medley a lot, and Mary Sue is one of Beth's best comedy filks. 
* *Apocalypse Blues* (2009) - This is when the Player Characters went from being "backing musicians for Beth's first album" and became a *band*. Beth started writing specifically for the band, especially the Apocalypse Blues trilogy, our first real prog-rock epic. More than anything else, this is when we figured out our sound. 
* *Songs About Robots & Death* (2009, out of print) - Our rare first EP, with covers of various anime theme songs (which we couldn't get rights for, hence out of print), and some of Beth's originals about anime. I *love* this record. Great songs, great mixes, great performances. Too bad you'll probably never hear it. 
* *All of My Heroes Are Villains* (2008) - The record that started it all. I knew Beth from Marscon and from doing a random gig with her (when I was in a short-lived band called Late November), and we were Livejournal friends, and I knew I really liked her songwriting. She wanted to record her first album, and I offered to produce it for her. I'd never produced an album before, but I wanted to. We didn't know wtf we were doing, so we decided to record an entire album in a month, in January. It was *insane*. She brought her friend Nikki Walker in to do some backing vocals, and I fell in love with her beautiful voice and harmonizing skills. I was going to try a couple of different drummers, but the first one was Justin Hartley from my band, the Feng Shui Ninjas, and Beth was "That's it, *he* is our drummer". Thus, a band formed, and a musical partnership that has lasted for 14 years now. 

### with Gernsback Continuum
* *Rocket Surgery* (coming in 2022) 
* *Hero* (2022) - A two-track preview EP for Rocket Surgery material. 

### with Feng Shui Ninjas
The Feng Shui Ninjas were always much more of a live band than a recording act, but we had some very good moments. I really, really wish we had recordings of our legendary NO MERCY CHRISTMAS shows, which were spectacularly chaotic events. 

* *I Like It* (2014) - Our last single, an absolutely absurd bit of music. I was fond of making up different lyrics on the spot live, and tried to never repeat myself. 
* *Livin Every Dae As Though Yer Deid* (2011) - An EP we recorded as the audience entry music for my spouse's dance show "Dancing with Death". It suffers from my rather bad production/mixing of the era, but has some delightful material - the title track is probably the second most Ninjas thing we ever recorded

### as Explosive Space Modulator
I sometimes play solo improvised space music under this name. 

* *Live at Mounds Theater* (2016) - A live recording from a show I produced of solo electric guitar performers, along with Ionosphere Casting Shadows, Crysanthemum, and Primadonahue. It's actually mostly pretty good, if you like this sort of thing. 
* *Trapped* (2016) - A release of an experimental recording from 2004 or so. I had just gotten recording equipment, including a Lexicon sound card that had a built-in digital reverb, so I made an all-reverb improv. I was definitely on to something! 

### as Al Amarja
Al Amarja was my pseudonym for music I composed for various bellydance shows my spouse produced at the Fringe Festival. Some of it is solo, some of it has other performers. 

* *Al Amarja* (2016). A "best of" collection of Al Amarja recordings. I think some of this holds up very well, particularly "Surviving", "Monster Within", and "Ghul".
