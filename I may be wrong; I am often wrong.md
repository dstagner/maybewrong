You are on the threshold of my garden. Please, enter. 

My name is Dave, and this is my mind garden. What is a mind garden? Well, at the moment, I'm not really sure. Like gardens in the physical world, mind gardens come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and even purposes. Physical gardens are a balance of the human intent to create form and meaning, and Nature's way of growing as She pleases, with no regard for our intentions. 

All gardens have boundaries, a form that says "this is in the garden", and "this is not in the garden". A garden, then, is a way of curating the experience of ever-changing Nature, to shape what both gardener and visitor get out of the garden. 

It seems to me, as of the moment I am writing this sentence, that a "mind garden" as an attempt to curate my thoughts, to shape what I experience and what others experience of them as well. It's pruned, and weeded. Seeds of ideas are planted, to flourish or die as they will. Paths are here, and architecture to draw the eye. It is evolving, and will continue to evolve. 

I hope you enjoy my garden. 

## I may be wrong; I am often wrong
You may have noticed the title. This is a phrase I have used for some years now. I try to use it whenever I find myself expounding with authority on some subject. It's particularly useful in my profession, where I often mentor junior engineers. I want them to understand that just because I speak with seniority, authority, and confidence does *not* mean that I am always right. I am *often* wrong, and they should feel free to challenge me if they disagree, or enlighten me if they think I'm missing some important information. 

But more importantly, it's a reminder to myself. I may be wrong; I am often wrong. But I want to be right. And it's not enough to *feel* right, especially when that feeling turns to pride and status. I'd much, much rather admit I was wrong and become right, than continue to insist that I'm right when I'm actually wrong. And I may be wrong; I am often wrong. 

## What will you find in my garden?
I am interested in a wide variety of things. That's one of the things that attracted me to the idea of a mind garden. A *blog* feels like it should be more constrained, focused on a single subject, but that' not how my mind works. I feel connections between seemingly disparate subjects. I'm a big picture thinker by nature, a holistic thinker. I want to present my thoughts in a more holistic way. Hopefully, this will be somewhat successful. 

Here are a few of the topics you might discover here:
* Clean energy and the environment
* Music I have created
* Reviews of books, films, and tv series
