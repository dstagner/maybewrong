title: Longtermism

> Future people count. There could be a lot of them. And we can make their lives better.
> - William MacAskill, *What We Owe the Future*

I have always thought about the future, and what I thought was the long term - thousands of years. But until discovering *longtermism* and reading *[[What We Owe the Future]]*, my vision was... small. Far too small. Now, I think of "the future" as encompassing the entirety of human existence, from now to the passing of the last human - which could, theoretically, be *billions* of years from now. On the other hand, there is a very real possibility that humanity will drive itself to extinct before the end of even my own natural lifespan.  

That's a lot to think about.

### A thought experiment
Suppose you're out walking on a trail, and you drop a glass bottle, and it breaks. You don't clean it up. Later on, a child steps on the broken glass and gets injured. Are you morally responsible for that child's injury? Most people would say yes. 

Ok, what if that child is injured 500 years from now? Are you still morally responsible? If not, why not? Are you equally morally responsible as you would be if the child was injured tomorrow? If not, why not? It's hard to conclude anything else but the idea that your actions may resonate morally for as long as there are humans to experience the consequences of your actions, not without some hard-to-defend rationalizations. 

### What can I do?
I've been thinking about this a lot. MacAskill helped found [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/), an organization dedicated to helping people find careers that have maximum positive impact (80,000 hours is about how much time you spend on your career). But I'm 57 years old. I'm more interested in retirement than in changing careers now. But I have the career that I have (as a DevOps engineer in enterprise IT), so how can apply that? Or do I have other skills I can apply? 

But I should start with "What needs to be done?" Yes, there are existential threats to civilization and even humanity itself, threats that need addressed. But am I the one to address them? Take nuclear war, for instance. It's a terrible threat. But is there anything meaningful I can do about it? It's a political problem, and a military one. Democratic action and institutions might work in the West, but plenty of nuclear powers are not at all democratic, and social pressure to disarm would be tantamount to revolution. 

Then there's the threat of a man-made epidemic. With that, I mostly worry about a lone terrorist, the ultimate mass murderer. How am I supposed to stop that? What one lunatic with a CRISPR machine could do? No, that just makes me feel helpless. 

I had been thinking about climate change, about ending fossil fuel consumption with new energy technologies. But there, I feel like society will actually take care of the problem. We are on the verge of a point where market forces, not altruism, drive conversion away from fossil fuels. They're becoming too expensive, even with the massive benefits of externalized costs for their profitability. 

### Another way of thinking
But when engaging with longtermism, it's not just existential threats that matter. Quality of life matters as well. And there are existential threats to factors that affect the quality of life of future people, as well. 

What I'm thinking about now is species diversity and ecosystem preservation. That's something where I can feel relevant. 

Every species lost to extinction is a species the people of the future will know only from history books. And every ecosystem lost takes with it more species, causes more extinctions. For most of the species lost, there will be no record, because we don't even know about them. That's why the dream of restoring extinct species from their DNA is just hubris. It's not just the big, recognizable animal that matters. It's all the uncountable, unknowable species of insects, of plants, of bacteria that make the world they live in. What's the point of having a mammoth that only lives in a zoo? 

Unlike clean energy, ecosystem preservation will never be profitable. We can't count on the market to do for us what needs done. It's purely a matter of political pressure, by individuals and institutions. Moreover, it's a place where direct action really, really matters. When the highway is going through regardless, maybe all we can do is dig up those little bristleberry plants and move them somewhere nearby, and hope we can save some of them.
