# Mailing lists I follow
In order to follow a mailing list, I want a few things. The first is consistently stimulating content. I want it to make me think. The second is a reasonable rate of flow - it should not be overwhelming or spammy. And finally, any commercial content needs to be subservient to the intellectual content.
