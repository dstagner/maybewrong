title: "TV Review: Moonhaven"
---
It's refreshing to see a science fiction tv series that is actually science fiction, not just cowboys in space. 

And so far, it's a refreshing change from the "utopia is secretly dystopia" theme of so much modern SF. It's great to see characters who truly believe in the utopia and try to save it.
