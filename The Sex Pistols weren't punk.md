If the Sex Pistols were punk, then a screaming toddler who needs some Goldfish crackers and a nap is punk. 

Being an angry young man who shouts NO at everything isn't punk. It's pedestrian and boring. Punk says YES, even if it's inventing something to say YES for. Anger is merely destructive. Punk is constructive. Punk is the DIY ethos. It's about creating something from nothing because you know it needs to exist. 

The B-52s were way more punk than the Sex Pistols. They created a sound and an image that was instantly recognizable and memorable, a sound that can't be imitated. They cranked out amazing pop gems like Rock Lobster and Love Shack, and they can't even be covered, they're so perfectly done, so inseparable from what the B-52s were.
