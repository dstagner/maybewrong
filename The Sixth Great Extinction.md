title: The Sixth Great Extinction - or is it?

> Our actions are destroying and threatening so many species that people have suggested a sixth mass extinction is underway. Is this true? 
> It is difficult to say. (...) there is more than one measure of a mass extinction. The rate at which species are going extinct is much higher than the longterm average - at least ten to 100 times higher, and expected to accelerate. Species may be going extinct even more rapidly than in a typical mass extinction. But the fraction of species that have gone extinct is much lower than in a mass extinction. Where the big five mass extinctions all lost more than 75 percent of species, we have lost about 1 percent. This could be a sixth mass extinction is just getting started, though the evidence fits a substantially smaller extinction event just as well. In any event, our inability to rule out being in the midst of a mass extinction is deeply troubling.

I read this quote this morning, and it gave me pause. For many years, I've just assumed we are in the midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction, that what we are doing to species diversity now is comparable to the Chicxulub asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. Now, I'm not so certain. Maybe we're at the beginning of a mass extinction - or maybe we can stop it before it becomes one. 

It seems to me, as not-a-naturalist, that the dominant cause of anthropogenic extinction is a loss of habitat. Species go extinct not because we deliberately hunt them (although that has happened), but because their habitat just happened to be where we wanted to "develop" a farm or a city. For example, here in Minnesota, less than 1% of the oak savannah habitat that covered much of the state still remains. The rest is farmland or urban. This has devastated our species. 

But many still remain. Most still remain. And we can save them, if we try. This is why I'm enamoured with E.O. Wilson's [Half Earth](https://www.half-earthproject.org/) idea. If we start protecting habitat, not as isolated preserves, but as large, connected systems, we can save most of Earth's species that might otherwise fall to anthropogenic change.
