The energy grid has a new problem. Periods of surplus renewable energy from wind and solar farms are sometimes actually driving prices *negative*. Producers have to pay customers to take power off their hands, in order to keep the grid stable. Here in Minnesota, idled wind turbines are a pretty common sight, shut down to keep from overloading the grid. 

This is an inevitable consequence of the nature of renewable energy, and the nature of demand. Nature creates energy when the Sun shines and the wind blows, which is not necessarily when we want to run our air conditioners or our lights. So at a certain point, renewables create more energy than we can use, while also not making enough energy when we need it. This puts a ceiling on how much renewable energy we can add to the grid, without stabilizing it with, well, fossil fuels. This should not be acceptable. And it is not an unsolvable problem. 

## What do you want? What is your problem? 
What we want is to stop using fossil fuels, as quickly as possible. 

Our problem is that we need to provide power to the grid to match demand, which varies by time of day and by season. The obvious sources for replacing fossil electricity are wind and solar, but their output varies by time of day and season too, but on a completely independent schedule. Too much generation can blow the grid, not enough means brownouts or blackouts. 

## How do we solve it? 
There are two things we can do - shift surplus energy *where*, or shift energy *when*. Move it in space, or move it in time. These are separate solutions and require separate approaches. 

### Changing the grid
By shift *where*, I mean generating energy in one place for use in another, over potentially very long distances. For example, if Texas is experiencing high demand but the wind is low there, and Iowa is windy, then Iowa could sell surplus wind to Texas. But doing this would require massive infrastructure improvements to the grid, and legal improvements as well. It would require a network of long distance, high voltage power lines capable of carrying massive power. It also requires massive regulatory improvements. For example, that power needs to cross Missouri and Arkansas (or perhaps Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma) on the way to Texas. So each state is providing support and will require compensation, and it needs to be set up in a way that states can't mess with the internal regulation of other states. 

### Storing the surplus energy
This is shifting *when*, separating when the energy is generated from when it is used. Surplus energy can be used to: 
* charge batteries
* heat large thermal masses
* lift heavy weights
* pump water uphill
* compress air
* generate synthetic fuels

The energy, once stored, can be used to generate electricity later, or used directly for other things (for example, stored heat can be used as heat, rather than converted to electricity). 

Storage can shift the where as well as the when, too. Batteries and synthetic fuels, in particular, can be highly mobile.
